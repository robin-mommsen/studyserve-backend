🚀 Server Project

Welcome to our Server Backend!
This project is part of a collaborative university project where we work together as a team to develop a complete application. 🎓
While the backend is being developed here by me alone, other team members are working on areas such as the frontend, documentation, and infrastructure. 💻 🌐

Note:
This repository is mirrored from my private GitLab instance to this GitHub repository.
Therefore, files such as the .gitlab-ci.yml (and other GitLab-specific configurations) can be safely ignored, as they are only relevant for the original GitLab setup.
